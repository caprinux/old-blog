Finally! We are getting started on the real stuff üòè

If you have followed along this series so far, congratulations on coming thus far!

You have only just started on your road to becoming a pwn god and I hope you enjoy your journey :)

## Buffer Overflow Concept

Consider the following program.

```c
// gcc secret.c -o secret
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    char secret[20] = "you cant touch me";
    char name[10];

    puts("What is your name?");
    scanf("%s", &name);
    printf("Hello %s\n", &name);
    puts(&secret);
    return 0;
}
```

The program contains a variable `secret[20]`, which contains `you cant touch me`.

Nowhere in this program writes into this variable which means that we should not be able to modify the variable.

However, are we really not able to do so?

This program takes in an input **(with no size limit)** into a variable `name[10]`, with size limit of 10 bytes.

What would happen if we just continue to input more characters, and if we are not stopped by a canary?

We could possible overwrite other stuff. Let's have a look at our stack layout.

If we exceed `name[10]`, we will then write into `secret[20]` and more.

Let's test it out!

![image](/pwn/images/i touched secret.jpg)

We managed to overwrite `secret` with whatever we want, even though there is no function allowing us to write to `secret`.

That is the essence of buffer overflow.

**Overwriting things to use the program in ways it was not intended to be used.**

## Automating a BOF with pwntools

However, what if our buffer is like 50 bytes, does that mean we have to type out all 50 bytes?

We can use PwnTools - a python module built specifically for pwning.

```py
from pwn import *

p = process('./secret') # run the process
p.sendline("A"*10 + "i_touched_secret!") # send an input to the process
p.interactive() # go back to manually running the program
```

## Let's put this into action.

We will try 2 **Buffer Overflow** practices now.

Source code will **not** be provided, this is a good chance for you to practice your decompilation as well.
